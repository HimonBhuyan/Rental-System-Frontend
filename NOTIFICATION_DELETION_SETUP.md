# Real-Time Notification Deletion Feature

## âœ… What Has Been Implemented

### 1. Enhanced WebSocket Server
- **Updated `notification-server.js`** to broadcast `NOTIFICATION_DELETED` events
- When a notification is deleted via API, all connected WebSocket clients receive real-time updates
- Includes deleted notification details for better user feedback

### 2. Enhanced Client-Side WebSocket Handler
- **Updated `RealTimeNotificationContext.jsx`** to handle `NOTIFICATION_DELETED` events
- Automatically updates the notifications list across all connected browsers/tabs
- Shows toast notifications when deletions occur
- Updates localStorage for cross-tab synchronization

### 3. Updated App Architecture
- **Switched from `NotificationContext` to `RealTimeNotificationContext`** in the main app
- All components now use WebSocket-based real-time notifications
- Components updated: `App.jsx`, `TenantDashboard.jsx`, `OwnerDashboard.jsx`, `Modal.jsx`

### 4. Enhanced Notification Context Features
- **Improved `deleteNotification` function** with:
  - Real-time WebSocket broadcasting
  - Cross-browser API synchronization
  - Comprehensive error handling and fallbacks
  - Better logging and toast notifications

## ðŸš€ How to Test the Feature

### Prerequisites
1. Ensure the notification server is running:
   ```bash
   node notification-server.js
   ```
2. Start the React development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Test Steps

#### Test 1: Admin to Tenant Real-Time Deletion
1. **Open Admin Dashboard** (Owner role)
   - Go to notifications management
   - Open browser developer console to see WebSocket logs

2. **Open Tenant Dashboard** in a different browser/tab
   - Open browser developer console to see WebSocket logs
   - Note the current notification count

3. **Delete a notification from Admin Dashboard**
   - Use the delete button on any notification
   - Watch the console logs for deletion events

4. **Check Tenant Dashboard**
   - The notification should disappear automatically (real-time)
   - You should see a toast notification about the deletion
   - Check browser console for `NOTIFICATION_DELETED` WebSocket event

#### Test 2: Cross-Browser Testing
1. **Open Admin Dashboard** in Chrome
2. **Open Tenant Dashboard** in Firefox/Edge
3. **Delete notifications from Admin** and observe real-time updates in the other browser

#### Test 3: Cross-Tab Testing  
1. **Open multiple tabs** with Admin and Tenant dashboards
2. **Delete notifications** from one tab
3. **Observe real-time updates** in all other tabs

### Expected Behavior

When a notification is deleted:

1. **Real-Time WebSocket Event**: All connected clients receive `NOTIFICATION_DELETED` event
2. **Automatic UI Updates**: Notification lists update immediately without page refresh
3. **Toast Notifications**: Users see "Notification deleted: [title]" message
4. **Cross-Browser Sync**: Changes appear in all browsers via API sync
5. **Cross-Tab Sync**: Changes appear in all tabs via localStorage events
6. **Console Logging**: Detailed logs show the deletion process

### Troubleshooting

#### WebSocket Connection Issues
- Check if notification server is running on port 3001
- Look for WebSocket connection logs in browser console
- Server will fall back to API polling if WebSocket fails

#### Notifications Not Updating
- Check browser console for error messages
- Verify localStorage is being updated
- Force refresh the notifications manually

## ðŸ”§ Technical Details

### WebSocket Message Format
```javascript
{
  type: 'NOTIFICATION_DELETED',
  deletedId: 1234567890,
  deletedNotification: { /* notification object */ },
  allNotifications: [ /* updated notifications array */ ],
  total: 8
}
```

### API Endpoints Used
- `DELETE /api/notifications/:id` - Delete specific notification
- `GET /api/notifications` - Get all notifications (fallback)

### Key Files Modified
- `notification-server.js` - Enhanced DELETE endpoint with WebSocket broadcasting
- `src/context/RealTimeNotificationContext.jsx` - Added NOTIFICATION_DELETED handler
- `src/App.jsx` - Switched to RealTimeNotificationProvider
- `src/components/tenant/TenantDashboard.jsx` - Updated to use real-time context
- `src/components/owner/OwnerDashboard.jsx` - Updated to use real-time context
- `src/components/Modal.jsx` - Updated to use real-time context

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

The real-time notification deletion feature is now fully implemented and ready for testing. When you delete notifications from the admin side, they will automatically disappear from the client side in real-time across all browsers and tabs.

Run the test script to verify the API functionality:
```bash
node test-delete-notification.js
```
