# Simple Context Test Guide

## ✅ What We've Done
Switched from the complex NotificationContext to SimpleNotificationContext to get back to a working state.

## 🔧 Key Changes
- Uses `simpleNotifications` localStorage key (not `notifications`)  
- Much simpler implementation without complex global state management
- Should restore the working functionality you had before

## 🧪 Quick Test

1. **Restart React app**: `npm run dev`
2. **Login as Admin** - check header numbers
3. **Click "🧪 Test Notification"** - does Context/Storage increase?
4. **Click "📜 History"** - does notification appear in history?
5. **Switch to Tenant** - check header numbers
6. **Check if notifications show** in tenant dashboard

## 📊 Expected Results

### Admin Dashboard Header:
`📋 Context: 1 | 💾 Storage: 1 | 🔗 simple`

### Tenant Dashboard Header:  
`📋 Context: 1 | 🔎 Filtered: 1 | 💾 Storage: 1`

## 🔍 Debug Steps

If it still doesn't work:

1. **Clear all localStorage**: In browser console run:
   ```javascript
   localStorage.clear()
   location.reload()
   ```

2. **Check console for errors** - any red error messages?

3. **Use debug buttons**:
   - Admin: "🔍 Debug" button
   - Tenant: "🧪 Test Filter" button

4. **Check what type notifications have**:
   - Look for `Type: "common"` vs `Type: null` in console logs

This simple context should definitely work since it's much cleaner than the complex version we were using!
