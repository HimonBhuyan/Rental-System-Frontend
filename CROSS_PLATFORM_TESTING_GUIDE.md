## üìã Test Cases

### Test 1: Owner Profile Cross-Browser Sync
**Objective**: Verify Owner profile updates sync in real-time across different browsers

**Steps**:
1. Open Browser A (e.g., Chrome): `http://localhost:5173`
2. Open Browser B (e.g., Firefox): `http://localhost:5173` 
3. Login as Owner in both browsers using owner credentials
4. Navigate to Owner Dashboard ‚Üí Profile in both browsers
5. In Browser A:
   - Click "Edit" on Basic Information

   - Change phone number
   - Click "Save"
6. **Expected Result**: Browser B should immediately show updated name and phone
7. In Browser B:
   - Click "Edit" on Building Details  
   - Change building name to "Updated Building"
   - Change total floors to a different number
   - Click "Save"
8. **Expected Result**: Browser A should immediately show updated building info

### Test 2: Client Profile Cross-Browser Sync  
**Objective**: Verify Client profile updates sync in real-time across different browsers

**Steps**:
1. Open Browser A: `http://localhost:5173`
2. Open Browser B: `http://localhost:5173`
3. Login as Tenant in both browsers using tenant credentials
4. Navigate to Tenant Dashboard ‚Üí Profile in both browsers
5. In Browser A:
   - Click "Edit Profile" 
   - Change name from "John Doe" to "John Updated"
   - Change emergency contact details
   - Click "Save Changes"
6. **Expected Result**: Browser B should immediately show updated name and contacts
7. In Browser B:
   - Click "Edit Profile"
   - Change rental details (rent amount, lease dates)
   - Upload a document
   - Click "Save Changes"  
8. **Expected Result**: Browser A should immediately show updated rental details and document

### Test 3: Cross-Platform Profile Photo Sync
**Objective**: Verify profile photos update in real-time across platforms

**Steps**:
1. Open on Windows Browser: `http://localhost:5173`
2. Open on Mobile Browser (or different OS): `http://localhost:5173`
3. Login as Owner on both devices
4. On Windows:
   - Go to Owner Profile ‚Üí Basic Information
   - Click camera icon to upload profile photo
   - Choose and upload an image
5. **Expected Result**: Mobile browser should immediately show the new profile photo
6. Repeat test with Tenant profile on both devices

### Test 4: Document Upload Cross-Browser Sync
**Objective**: Verify document uploads sync across browsers

**Steps**:
1. Open Browser A and B with Tenant logged in
2. In Browser A:
   - Go to Tenant Profile ‚Üí Documents section
   - Upload Government ID document
3. **Expected Result**: Browser B should immediately show the uploaded document
4. In Browser B:
   - Upload Rental Agreement document
3. **Expected Result**: Browser A should immediately show both documents

### Test 5: WebSocket Connection Recovery
**Objective**: Verify system works when WebSocket connection is interrupted

**Steps**:
1. Open Browser with Owner logged in
2. Go to Network tab in Developer Tools
3. Block WebSocket connections temporarily
4. Make profile changes and save
5. **Expected Result**: Changes should save to database via API
6. Restore WebSocket connections
7. **Expected Result**: Real-time sync should resume automatically

## üîç Debugging Tools

### Browser Console Logs:
Look for these log patterns to verify functionality:

**Profile Loading**:
```
üìÇ [OwnerProfile] Loading profile data...
üåç [OwnerProfile] Loading from backend...
‚úÖ [OwnerProfile] Backend response: {...}
```

**Profile Saving**:
```  
üöÄ [OwnerProfile] Save button clicked - starting save process...
üì§ [OwnerProfile] Sending data to backend: {...}
‚úÖ [OwnerProfile] Profile saved successfully: {...}
üì° [OwnerProfile] Broadcast to X WebSocket clients
```

**WebSocket Events**:
```
üì® [RealTimeContext] WebSocket message: OWNER_PROFILE_UPDATED
üîÑ Owner profile updated: Updated Owner Name
üîÑ Tenant profile updated: John Updated
```

### Network Tab:
- Verify API calls to `/api/owner/profile` and `/api/tenant/profile`
- Check WebSocket connection to `ws://localhost:3001`
- Confirm proper HTTP status codes (200 for success)

### Application Tab:
- Check localStorage for profile data backup
- Verify JWT tokens are stored correctly

---

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

### All tests pass if:
1. **Data Persistence**: All profile changes save to database permanently
2. **Real-time Sync**: Changes appear immediately in other browsers/tabs
3. **Cross-Browser**: Works in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
4. **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, Mac, Mobile browsers  
5. **Document Uploads**: Files upload and display correctly across devices
6. **Profile Photos**: Images sync instantly across all sessions
7. **WebSocket Recovery**: Connection auto-recovers after network issues
8. **Offline Resilience**: System works when WebSocket is unavailable

## üö® Troubleshooting

### If real-time sync fails:
1. Check WebSocket connection status in browser console
2. Verify backend server is running and WebSocket server is active
3. Check for firewall or network blocking WebSocket connections
4. Try refreshing the page to re-establish WebSocket connection

### If profiles don't save:
1. Check JWT token is valid and not expired
2. Verify API endpoints are accessible
3. Check MongoDB Atlas connection
4. Review browser console for error messages

### If documents don't upload:
1. Verify file size is under 5MB limit
2. Check file types are PDF, JPG, JPEG, or PNG
3. Ensure user is in editing mode
4. Check localStorage and database for document data

## üìä Expected Performance

- **Profile Load Time**: < 2 seconds from database
- **Save Response Time**: < 3 seconds to complete save and sync
- **Real-time Update Delay**: < 1 second across browsers
- **WebSocket Reconnection**: < 5 seconds after connection loss
- **Document Upload**: < 10 seconds for 5MB files

---

## üéØ Final Validation

Both Owner and Client profiles should now:
‚úÖ Save all data to MongoDB Atlas database  
‚úÖ Load complete profile data on page load
‚úÖ Update in real-time across all browsers and tabs
‚úÖ Handle document uploads with base64 storage
‚úÖ Maintain consistent state across platforms
‚úÖ Recover gracefully from network interruptions
‚úÖ Provide visual feedback during all operations

The system is ready for production use with full cross-platform and cross-browser support!
