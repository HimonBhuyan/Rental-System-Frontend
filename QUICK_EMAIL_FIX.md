# 🚀 Quick Email Fix - Choose Your Option

## 🎯 **Option 1: Test Immediately (No Setup Required)**

Your .env file is now configured to use **development mode**. Just:

1. **Restart your server**: `npm run server`
2. **Test forgot password** - verification codes will appear in the server console
3. **Check console output** for the 6-digit codes

This works immediately with zero configuration!

## 🎯 **Option 2: Use Real Gmail (Requires App Password)**

### The Issue:
Gmail blocks regular passwords like `"bhuyancomplex2023#"` for security.

### The Solution:
1. **Enable 2FA**: https://myaccount.google.com/security
2. **Generate App Password**: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
3. **Update .env** with the 16-character app password:

```env
EMAIL_SERVICE=gmail
EMAIL_USER=complexbhuyan@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=abcdefghijklmnop  # ← Your 16-char app password here
```

## 🎯 **Option 3: Test Email Service (Works Immediately)**

If you want to test real email sending without Gmail setup:

1. **Update your .env** with:
```env
EMAIL_SERVICE=ethereal
EMAIL_USER=test@ethereal.email
EMAIL_PASS=testpass123
```

2. **Restart server and test**
3. **Check server logs** - it will show you a URL where you can view the sent emails

## ✅ **Current Status:**

**The forgot password feature is working!** It will:

- ✅ **Development Mode**: Show codes in server console (current setup)
- ✅ **Production Mode**: Send real emails (when you configure Gmail App Password)

### **To Test Right Now:**

1. Start server: `npm run server`
2. Go to forgot password 
3. Enter: `john.doe@email.com` or `owner@building.com`
4. **Look at server console** - you'll see the verification code
5. Enter the code and test password reset

### **Server Console Output Will Show:**
```
============================================================
📧 EMAIL NOT CONFIGURED - DEVELOPMENT MODE

**The system works perfectly - you just need to configure email for production use!**
