# üêõ DEBUG: Custom Notifications Not Working

## **üîç DEBUGGING STEPS**

I've added debugging to track what's happening when you create custom notifications vs test notifications.

### **Step 1: Open Browser Console**
1. Open `http://localhost:3000`
2. Press **F12** to open Developer Tools
3. Go to **Console** tab
4. Keep it open while testing

### **Step 2: Test Working Notification**
1. Login as **Admin**
2. Click **"üß™ Test Notification"** button
3. **Check Console** for:
   ```
   üß™ [Admin] WORKING Test Notification: {object}
   üíæ [Admin] localStorage after test notification: X notifications
   ```

### **Step 3: Test Custom Notification**
1. Click **"Post Notifications"** 
2. Fill in the form:
   - Keep **"Common Notification"** selected
   - **Category:** Information
   - **Title:** "My Custom Notification"  
   - **Message:** "This is my custom notification"
   - **Priority:** Medium
3. Click **"Send Notification"**
4. **Check Console** for:
   ```
   üîç [Modal] Form data from postNotifications:
   - notificationType: common
   - category: info
   - title: My Custom Notification
   - message: This is my custom notification
   - priority: medium
   üöÄ [Modal] Created notification object: {object}
   ‚úÖ [Modal] Notification sent via addNotification function
   ```

### **Step 4: Compare Results**

**If you see both sets of logs but tenant doesn't get custom notification:**
- The issue is in the notification content format
- Check if the `type` field is correct

**If you DON'T see the modal logs:**
- The form submission isn't working
- Check for JavaScript errors in console

### **Step 5: Check Tenant Side**
1. Open **another tab/browser**
2. Login as **Tenant**
3. Check if notification appears in panel
4. **Check Console** for tenant-side logs

## **üîß QUICK FIXES**

### **Fix 1: If notificationType is null/undefined**
The radio button might not be properly selected.

### **Fix 2: If notification object looks different from test**
There might be a format mismatch.

### **Fix 3: If no console logs from modal**
The form might have validation errors.

## **üìã WHAT TO LOOK FOR**

Compare these two objects in console:
- **Test notification** (working): `üß™ [Admin] WORKING Test Notification`
- **Custom notification** (not working): `üöÄ [Modal] Created notification object`

They should have the same structure:
```javascript
{
  type: "common",
  title: "...",
  message: "...",
  category: "info", 
  priority: "medium"
}
```

**Test it now and let me know what console logs you see!**
