üìß QUICK EMAIL SETUP FOR FORGOT PASSWORD

=== TO SEND EMAILS TO REAL EMAIL ADDRESSES ===

1. Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/security
   - Enable "2-Step Verification" if not already enabled

2. Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords  
   - Select "Mail" app and generate password
   - Copy the 16-character password (like: abcd efgh ijkl mnop)

3. Edit your .env file and replace:
   EMAIL_USER=himonbhuyan@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASS=your-16-character-app-password-here

4. Restart your server: npm run server

5. Test with any email address:
   - john.doe@email.com (tenant)
   - jane.smith@email.com (tenant) 
   - owner@building.com (owner)
   - himonbhuyan@gmail.com (any role)

=== HOW IT WORKS ===
Your Gmail (himonbhuyan@gmail.com) will send verification codes TO any user's email address they enter in the forgot password form.

=== TROUBLESHOOTING ===
- If you get authentication error: Make sure 2FA is enabled and you're using App Password
- If emails don't arrive: Check spam folder
- Check server console for detailed error messages

=== CURRENT STATUS ===
‚úÖ Frontend: Working (modal, validation, UI)
‚úÖ Backend: Working (API endpoints, code generation)
‚úÖ Database: Working (user lookup)
‚ùå Email: Needs Gmail App Password configuration

Once you configure the email settings, the forgot password feature will send real emails!
